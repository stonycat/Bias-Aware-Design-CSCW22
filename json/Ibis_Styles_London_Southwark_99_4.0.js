They both had a large amounts of fake tan on!   2. The bed.. I booked a double room at the hotel. The bed has a double duvet and sheet. But as I got into bed and lied in the middle I soon realised it was two singles stuck together. This always annoys me when hotels do this, please why can’t you just give me a double bed!   3.

Borough Market is next door.  This time the first room I was given was very cold, but the staff moved me to another, which was fine except for a blocked shower outlet. I'm sure that both of these problems have since been fixed (I've stayed here several times and never encountered this before). The one thing my friends and I find strange is the mobile table that fits over the bed - unless you are having breakfast - or dinner - in bed it's not very useful and simply gets in the way (when sharing a room last time, we had to wedge the thing between the two beds in order to move around the room).", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": -0.421, "keywords": ["breakfast", "bed", "shower", "hotel", "london"], "matchKeywords": ["breakfast", "bed", "shower", "hotel", "london"], "categories": ["facility", "food", "surroundings"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}]}
