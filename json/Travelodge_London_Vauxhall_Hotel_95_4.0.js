The hotel itself is pretty OK - just as you would expect.  The front desk staff are lovely and welcoming, the premises pretty clean.  But the accommodation is quite small, very sparse and pared back.  Don't expect too much - just the bare necessities.  If you want to iron anything, you need to go to reception to get the iron and the board.  Also, if you want wifi during your stay, you have to pay for it.  Overall, not a bad stay, but felt a little rustic for the price and the brand.  I felt like I was in a college dorm room rather than a hotel room.

We stayed for three nights and the room was absolutely what we needed, with the surprising addition of a capsule coffee machine.  Some reviews mention that the reception is in the basement as if this was a bad thing!  You need to use your room key to open the front door on an evening, so hotel security is fine.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": 0.041, "keywords": ["hotel", "vauxhall", "hotels", "london", "coffee"], "matchKeywords": ["hotel", "vauxhall", "hotels", "london", "coffee"], "categories": ["facility", "surroundings", "food"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "WearyBob", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "21 contributions", "helpfulNum": "6 helpful votes", "currentRating": "4.0", "title": "Excellent Staff", "content": "I have stayed here on a number of occasions for work purposes.
