Very easy to get to from West of London. There is no parking with the actual hotel, however there is a big underground car park opposite in St George Wharf. Wasn't easy to find the car park but when we did it was easy to use. Decent size spaces, and plenty of them. Just had to cross the road then and plenty of safe crossing points.Cost \u00a338 for 12-24 hours, but better than being towed away. Two tube stops from Brixton so very easy for the concert.  The bus, train and underground stations are all just outside the hotel. There is also a Sainsburys Local and a small Waitrose - as well as Starbucks. Makes a great base to go and do whatever you are doing in London.  The hotel was very clean, modern decor, easily accessible etc.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": -0.011, "keywords": ["starbucks", "concert", "parking"], "matchKeywords": ["starbucks", "concert", "parking"], "categories": ["surroundings", "service"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "intrepidexplorersid", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "441 contributions", "helpfulNum": "225 helpful votes", "currentRating": "3.0", "title": "It is what it is", "content": "Stayed here in a super room which wasn't nearly as super as the Waterloo version.

The room could also hear again throughout the day and night the pipes, with taps being turned on and off. Giving out a loud wailing sound.  Breakfast.
