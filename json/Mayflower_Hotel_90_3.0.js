Be careful if you specifically booked this hotel because it has free parking as I did as I doubt no more than 4 cars can fit in their allocated parking area which is a few minutes walk away so request the space when booking as otherwise it's permit parking only in the area until 6.30pm but then you have to move your car by 8am the next morning to avoid getting a parking penalty.  The guy on reception was very friendly and helpful. As you walk in to the hotel you see how ornate it is with its slight Moroccan look. The marble reception desk has a wooden ornate surrounding with lots of ornaments, mirrors and vases. Opposite the receptions is the entrance to a seating area which again is pretty and ornate with  a blue lighted decorative bar, wall -mounted flat screen TV,  a PC desk set up tables, high padded seating and chairs and as if used as a dinning area too but due to the pandemic no food was being served and the bar was closed. The corridors to the rooms were also decorative although I did get a bit lost trying to find myself around as it's a bit of a maze. The room was spacious with white furniture and a lounging couch at the end of the bed. The decorative bedside tables has 2 drawers and a lamp on top. There was also a non-functioning fireplace, a fan, tea & coffee facilities, a fancy dressing table with stool and triple mirror, a wall-mounted flat screen TV, an armchair and a lovely ornate white double wardrobe with a safe in it and shelves rather than hanging space. The carpeted floor is very squeaky so there's no sneaking around at night without being heard. The bathroom is trendy and quite big with a double shower and a single square sink with a mirror above but there's a window at the shower end so you can see into the bathroom from the bedroom so you may want to share the room with someone you're comfortable with.", "time": " July 2020", "helpful_vote": 1, "polarity": -0.169, "keywords": ["30pm", "restaurants", "mcdonalds", "kfc", "trendy"], "matchKeywords": ["30pm", "restaurants", "trendy"], "categories": ["time", "facility", "emotional_descriptions"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "„Éû„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„Ç¥„É™„É©", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2020", "contriNum": "8 contributions", "helpfulNum": "5 helpful votes", "currentRating": "1.0", "title": "THE WORST HOTEL", "content": "This hotel is the worst hotel.
