Next to a Tube station, a short walk from Waterloo and South Bank.    I was very impressed upon arrival - a modern foyer without the conventional row of check-in counters.  Check-in itself was quick and easy.  The restaurant area was comfortable and the breakfasts we are there were of a good standard, definitely on par with the best Ibis breakfasts we have had.  We did have some issues with getting service at the bar/restaurant on a couple of occasions.  It looked like an extra pair of hands might have helped, rather than one staff member running around trying to sort everything.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": "0", "polarity": 0.376, "keywords": ["breakfasts", "restaurant", "modern", "clean", "impressed"], "matchKeywords": ["breakfasts", "restaurant", "modern", "clean", "impressed"], "categories": ["food", "facility"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "truehiker2016", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "37 contributions", "helpfulNum": "8 helpful votes", "currentRating": "5.0", "title": "Great experience ", "content": "So far the best ibis (and Accor) hotel I’ve been.
