I have to say that the location of the Hotel is superb. Not only do you have Paddington Station around the corner (Underground and Heathrow Express) but there's another Underground station just around the corner in the opposite direction (Edgware Road). Plus you are five minutes tops by bus to Marble Arch and Oxford Street. I have to remark that the neighbourhood is quite safe. I was never looking over my shoulder.
