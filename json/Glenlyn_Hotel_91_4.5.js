From this point onwards everything excellent. Great service, super room, great quality buffet breakfast. Great nights sleep, car securely parked right outside. Add to this all types of food to eat in the high street just 50 metres away. Tube station an easy 500metre walk Add all together and this is an absolute bargain of a place to stay.

Firstly, all rooms and areas are kept very clean. The bed was superb, quality mattresses gave us excellent nights' rest. The water pressure in the shower was brilliant, (unusual in a lot of hotels in my experience). The staff were, all really hard-working and charming, we were greeted with smiles and helpfulness at all times. Lastly, the breakfast was very good indeed, regularly being freshly replenished with all elements of a full-English. The furniture and decor were a bit tired but at these prices in London this is nitpicking.
