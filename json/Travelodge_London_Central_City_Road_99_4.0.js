Loved the room, all the staff were super helpful, lots of knowledge regarding tube stops and routes, printed off tickets for our London by night tour... nothing was too much trouble! Reception staff were also wonderful in dealing with an unforeseen  delay in our early check in. They looked after us and our children well after our long train journey while we waited for our room.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": 0.876, "keywords": ["train", "loved", "helpful", "rooms", "london"], "matchKeywords": ["train", "loved", "helpful", "rooms", "london"], "categories": ["surroundings", "facility"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "I7028ZMamyh", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "1 contribution", "helpfulNum": "0", "currentRating": "5.0", "title": "Perfect", "content": "Couldn’t fault it , the location is brilliant, right in the middle of everything so very easy to get around , really got beside a train station and plenty of nice restaurants surrounding,the room was clean and comfortable and the staff were a credit to the hotel ", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": 0.997, "keywords": ["comfortable", "clean", "hotel", "easy", "restaurants"], "matchKeywords": ["comfortable", "clean", "hotel", "easy", "restaurants"], "categories": ["facility"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "Eyupmiduck", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "83 contributions", "helpfulNum": "110 helpful votes", "currentRating": "5.0", "title": "Great Place to Stay", "content": "This was our second time staying at the City Road Travelodge (can't think why I didn't leave a review for the first stay!) and we found it to be very satisfactory.  We booked a Super Room which was clean and comfortable with pod coffee machine, hospitality tray with Kit-Kats, hairdryer right next to a full-length mirror and an iron and ironing board.  The bathroom was spotless with excellent lighting above the vanity and a good, hot shower with adjustable pressure.  We were there for two nights and we slept soundly on both.  Check-in was hassle-free and speedy courtesy of Dina on reception, who gave us all the information required and who booked our luggage into their store until our room was ready later in the day.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": 0.261, "keywords": ["bathroom", "shower", "restaurant", "slept", "coffee"], "matchKeywords": ["bathroom", "shower", "restaurant", "slept", "coffee"], "categories": ["facility", "food"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "Magicmonkie", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "11 contributions", "helpfulNum": "3 helpful votes", "currentRating": "5.0", "title": "Brilliant", "content": "The staff were wonderful and so helpful.
