Thank's Maria (the receptionist) for your warm wellcome and thank's also to the night receptionist that help me to get a anniversary cake to my wife's birthday at 11pm. Thank you all. The breakfast is quite good (included) and the staff is very nice always with \"genuine smiles\" in their faces. The rooms are not very big but comfy and quiet enough for a good and restful night sleep. In summary, for all the reasons above, I definitly recommend this hotel to your next London trip if you go \"on a budget\". Ah! And its realy very close to the Pimlico tube station (5 min) or Victoria Station (10min).",

              "content": " Visited for three nights mid January. Lovely hotel, pleasant staff, clean and well maintained. Had double room on 3 floor. Very quiet no sound from Road or adjoining rooms. Visited in jan and room quite hot, so summer could be problem. No air con (due to building being listed) however fan on wall.  Bathroom good, shower good pressure and not huge but plenty of room. Beware London water is very ‘soft’ go easy on soap or you’ll be rinsing forever! Breakfast was good, plenty of selection and grab and go option. Coffee ok but bit weak.  Location is superb, there really is a pub on every corner! Pint of Doom Bar and G & T ranges from £9.75 - £11.00. The Warwick has cocktails for £5.50. Cafe Nero, Boots and small Tesco and Waitrose handy for odd bits, otherwise great local shops,",
