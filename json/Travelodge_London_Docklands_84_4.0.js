The super rooms and late check out til 2pm are especially good. Our only real problem was that transport back to this hotel from the O2 Arena after a concert was big problem because the hotel's recommendation to use the Tube & DLR didnt mention that the tube and DLR service between O2 and the hotel becomes a nightmare after midnight. The DLR stopped running & their awful staff at Canning Town locked us out of the Bow Creek exit leaving us almost trapped in a fenced off pedestrian area between there & an unexpectedly locked gate to a footbridge. It took an hour to find a way out of that area & back to the hotel. It may be best to avoid the Tube and DLR after about 11.30pm and catch a bus or taxi.", "time": " December 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": -0.326, "keywords": ["30pm", "2pm", "midnight", "nightmare", "unexpectedly"], "matchKeywords": [], "categories": ["others"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "andy b", "user_wrote_time": "Dec 2018", "contriNum": "61 contributions", "helpfulNum": "55 helpful votes", "currentRating": "3.0", "title": "Good but room for improvement ", "content": "I stayed here in a family room with my wife and 2 small children for 2 nights.
