Four hangers, one very small desk and one uncomfortable chair were all the amenities. The room was dimly lit. Thus it's difficult to sit anywhere and do anything. All clothes had to remain in the suitcase in an unlit area of the room. The bathroom gets dripping wet from each shower due to inefficient ventilation.

We booked a room for 2 adults and a child. The child bed had no mattress - so our son had to sleep on the box springs. \"Yes, we've had lots of complaints about these - I don't know why they don't have a mattress\" said the man at the desk. \"I'd change your room, but unfortunately they're all the same.\" So we eventually got them to give us another duvet to put on the box spring. That took 90 minutes (thanks to a change of staff who didn't hand the problem over to each other) - so we didn't get to sleep till 11pm - late for a 9 year old.
