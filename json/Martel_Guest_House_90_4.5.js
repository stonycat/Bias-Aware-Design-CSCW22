Breakfast is included I am not really a breakfast person but did make a point of duty to visit the breakfast room, which is compact with outdoor sitting on the small patio in the garden Had a single room, small but every inch well used, with ample space for a TV, cupboard, fridge, safe, coffee/tea station and coffee machine and A/C. The room is tastefully decorated in black.  The bathroom or rather a wet cell was clean but dated, the grouting is in need of repair. Comfortable single bed, which was made every day, regular change of towels and a super-fast Wifi. View from the window is the neighbour's wall! Location is very good a 5 minutes walk to the Underground and bus station.

Just what I needed! A small homely and clean place in the Jewish neighborhood close to synagogues and Kosher restaurants. The proprietor was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were quiet. A pity their breakfast (which looked very good) was not Kosher. The bathroom was a little too small with a very noisy hot water pump system. On the whole I would recommend and return there myself.

Mr. Martel is always eager to help and ensure things run seamlessly. Everything is spotlessly clean and the place is very convenient for transport and shops, banks and restaurants.

Phil is an outright gentleman who will do everything possible to make your stay comfortable. We booked the family room for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids. The room and the bathroom was neat and clean and opened to a pleasing backyard. The bathroom was small particularly the shower stall but I guess, we are a bit spoilt in the US. Note that the water heater in the shower (at least in our room) is tankless and can take a bit of time to heat up. We were fine with the amenities and got adjusted pretty quickly.  The guest house is in a quiet neighborhood in Golders Green and easily accessible from the tube (northern line) and bus station.", "time": " March 2018", "helpful_vote": 2, "polarity": 0.21, "keywords": ["bathroom", "shower", "london", "house", "owner"], "matchKeywords": ["bathroom", "shower", "london"], "categories": ["facility", "loation_surroundings"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}]}
