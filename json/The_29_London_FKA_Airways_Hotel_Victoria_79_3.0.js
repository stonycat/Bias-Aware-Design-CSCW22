Breakfast was plentiful and a good selection of cereals, cold meats, pastries and juice. Staff were efficient in replenishing everything and tidying up.  The hotel is ideally positioned with shops, pharmacies, salons and a market within a few minutes walk. At night the area is well lit and quiet.

The basic design of the place was nice on first sight. The shower head strength was nice too (although drainage was a problem). The staff were reasonably friendly from the little contact we had with them.  The overall quality of our stay wasn't great, below average in fact. The wifi was so inadequate we couldn't even make basic google searches. The shower was blocked. The walls are paper thin. The light coming through the door alone was like having a light on. The room was freezing when we arrived. The 'double' bed was definitely a bit on the small side. The paint on the walls was patchy and didn't look clean. Carpets weren't especially clean either.

Breakfast was really good value for money in terms of the freshness and the variety - as well as the fact that the staff continuously refilled items well before they ran out. The receptionist gladly stored our luggage on our last day, while we toured the city. The only real inconvenience is that there is no lift, so travelling with significant amounts of luggage may become cumbersome.", "time": " December 2017", "helpful_vote": 1, "polarity": 0.129, "keywords": "['bathrooms', 'breakfast', 'bed', 'shower', 'hotel']", "categories": ["facility"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}]}
