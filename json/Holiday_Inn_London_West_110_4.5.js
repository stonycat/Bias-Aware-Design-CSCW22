However I feel compelled to leave a review on my recent stays at Holiday Inn, London West. All staff are very friendly, efficient, and clearly confident in their roles. This can only be due to strong management who know how to get the best out of their people. It makes such a difference. I love staying there, the hotel has a great atmosphere. The food is great, a decent choice of beers and wines. The hotel is just great value, near the tube for  London and very popular with good reason. Always clean, well looked after.
