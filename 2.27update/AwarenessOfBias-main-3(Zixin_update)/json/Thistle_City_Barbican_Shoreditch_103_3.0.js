The entrance to the hotel is lovely and very modern; however the rooms are not the same. We were put in the opposite building after changing our room numbers around - the rooms were basic and done the job. However there was an absolutely awful smell that did not ease over the 3 days we were here. We stayed in rooms 2422, 2423 & 2424 (room 2422 undoubtedly smelt the worst).  For this reason purely, I would be put off staying again.   However, everything else about the hotel was great. The bar in the main building was nice with a good TV to watch sports (etc), the food was also great (we ate dinner here one night - great selection as well as taste, catered for veggies too!)   The breakfast in the morning was standard enough.
