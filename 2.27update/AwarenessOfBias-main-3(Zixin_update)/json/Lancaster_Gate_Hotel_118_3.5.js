We were given a room at the end of a hall with a service closet on one side and the empty building next door on the other. It was quiet for our whole stay.  Our stay included a full English breakfast each morning, and it was quite ample to start our day - eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes, along with cereals, some fruit, pastries and juice.

Our room was immediately ready which was appreciated.  During the check in process, there was a group of young ladies at the front desk complaining loudly that their safe had been opened and money removed.  It was an auspicious start to our stay at Lancaster Gate, it made me feel very uneasy about leaving anything of value in the safe.
