Unfortunately, this visit was not nearly as good. We arrived and were checked in by a lady that wasn’t very friendly and really looked as though she did not want to be there. We were pleasantly surprised that we had been upgraded to an executive suite. When we entered the suite we found that we had one bed rather than a twin. As the bed was big enough to share we decided to just do that, rather than cause a fuss. That evening, my Mum went to use the shower and the tray looked as though it had not been cleaned; it was full of long dark hair. As it was late and she was about to get into bed, she did not call down to reception; she was too tired.

Only problem I had was on our second night there we had a meal in the restaurant just off the lobby . While my mates had the cheaper menu, because of my food allergies I had to order from the regular menu. This wasn’t a problem.  The food was sub standard cafeteria food and tasted like it had been heated in a microwave. For €12 for the main you’d expect linguini to actually be linguini, not reheated spaghetti.  The dining room staff were unnecessarily rude to my friends as we went to pay . Including the waitress who had been dealing with us . Other than that the rest of the hotel was fine .

This hotel is doing little to deserve patronage. It’s a huge hotel with little regard for the basics you would assume came with a hotel in a first world country. The good bit is that the staff are very pleasant and were in one particular case - extremely helpful. Props to Melania - someone headhunt her! But it’s the room experience that is most crucial. Our room had no aircon of any kind. The window was locked. Not even an overhead fan in the bathroom! The first time we tried to flush the toilet there was a plumbing problem. To be fair some help did arrive soon and we managed to get them to open the window while they were there. A day later the hand held shower unit fell because its metal neck on the wall had a chip.
