We were on our way out and had a very busy day planned as it was my husbands birthday, so we didnât have time to go and pack out things back up.  I just asked if they could have a look and maybe spray some air freshener.   We returned late that night and it was just the same.  I spoke to a lady on our way to check out and she reported the same problem in her room also.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": -0.461, "keywords": ["birthday", "weekend", "husband", "morning", "husbands"], "matchKeywords": ["birthday", "weekend", "husband"], "categories": ["travelling purpose", "companion"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "Munki S", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "69 contributions", "helpfulNum": "14 helpful votes", "currentRating": "5.0", "title": "Christmas break away", "content": "From booking to checking out, everything about our trip was fab. The hotel had parking which felt secure and it was easy to check in and get to our room. Although basic, our double room had a comfy big bed and tea making facilities. The bathroom was like something you'd expect on a spaceship, but it was just right for what we needed! We didn't make use of the bar/cafe downstairs, but it always seemed busy and had a good atmosphere. The location was ideal and was close to both the DLR and the river taxi, so within minutes you find yourself at all the famous attractions without too much hassle. Greenwich itself is lovely.  Steeped in history and has it's own attractions to see.", "time": " December 2017", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": 0.719, "keywords": ["spaceship", "hotel", "tea", "comfy", "cafe"], "matchKeywords": ["hotel", "tea", "comfy", "cafe"], "categories": ["food", "facility"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "John C", "user_wrote_time": "Jan 2018", "contriNum": "97 contributions", "helpfulNum": "17 helpful votes", "currentRating": "3.0", "title": "Last time?", "content": "Coming here since 2007 this Year is Perhaps the last time. December 2016 we failed to come because my dad died just before boarding the plane in Amsterdam. We informed Ibis and they just said âyou canât cancellâ. Not even Some Words of sympathy, but ok. This time arrived in the Evening and there was no counter, a young girl came upon us, sat down on a high table with a laptop and het I-phone. Just then we realised that was the counter. We checked in and the room was ok. For the next days we noticed a letter in the elevator telling the questions there would be a fire test that day ....... What day, iT still hangs there after 5 days.  Must say that most of the time there is nobody at the lounge for the guests.", "time": " January 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": -0.535, "keywords": ["died", "iphone", "december", "elevator", "2007"], "matchKeywords": ["elevator"], "categories": ["facility"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}]}
