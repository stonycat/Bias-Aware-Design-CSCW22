I had a good time there. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and helped me with many things you struggle with if you´re new in London.  The beds were very comfy - The window was a bit complicated to reach if you´re under 5'2\". We had the room at the very top (4th floor), facing the Belgrave road. Space could´ve been a bit hard to divide if you´re travelling with more than 2 suitcases since there´s almost no room for storage.
