Each morning there was a simple yet very adequate continental breakfast with decent variety. The room I was in was on the top floor and was really well designed. The location was exceptional for the tube station as well as walking to Kensington and exploring the museums. A real gem in London.

Very clean and comfortable, and is very close to Earl's Court Station. Breakfast is provided, not a huge spread but sufficient. I personally like the coffee and the croissant best. Just one thing to take note- as there could be guests checking in at any time of the day ( e.g. to store luggage at hotel), it would be good if hotel management could ensure there is at least 1 staff at the reception at all times.

Very clean and felt calm and relaxing. The shower was great and bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I’ve slept in! There is some outside space and tables to sit at. I think the only negative I could find would be with the towels! They were more like bathmats, as in thick and hard rather than think and soft.

The bathroom is separated from the room by a thin glass window, not thick frosted glass, clear glass. For 'privacy' there are plastic venetian blinds, which actually don't provide much privacy considering the toilet is less than a meter from someones pillow. If your partner turns the bathroom light on in the night its like they've turned the main lights on. So you'd better be comfortable with having your partner hear your every move in the bathroom (best pray no one gets sick like we did).
