# Awareness Of Bias_Hotel Review
Making an informed decision: Increasing awareness of potential bias in hotel ratings

## Milestone
### 2020.11.30
Idea Evaluation
#### Feedback:
1) The participants of the survey are the users of TripAdvisor
a. In the survey,  what kinds of travel/booking experience the participants required?
b. About the evaluation, how to set different scenarios to cover the different conditions to show the usefulness of the system instead of showing the best case? How many variables do we need to control?
2) How will you get the KEY information you want to show and the information must belong to SELF-SELECTION. How do you plan to tell this story? And I strongly recommend you to design a system. (similar to tripadvisor.com)

3) Maybe you should be careful to control the background of the participants, because this may also cause bias~
