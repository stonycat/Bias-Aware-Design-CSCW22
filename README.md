# Awareness Of Bias_Hotel Review
Making an informed decision: Increasing awareness of potential bias in hotel ratings

## Milestone
### 2020.11.30
Idea Evaluation
#### Feedback:
1) The participants of the survey are the users of TripAdvisor
a. In the survey,  what kinds of travel/booking experience the participants required?
b. About the evaluation, how to set different scenarios to cover the different conditions to show the usefulness of the system instead of showing the best case? How many variables do we need to control?
2) How will you get the KEY information you want to show and the information must belong to SELF-SELECTION. How do you plan to tell this story? And I strongly recommend you to design a system. (similar to tripadvisor.com)

3) Maybe you should be careful to control the background of the participants, because this may also cause bias~ 
4) RQ2. How can you distinguish between self-selection bias and for example social influence bias?
5)  if the backend algorithms could eliminate bias, why do end users need to be aware of the bias? What is transparent design.
6) how many participants in the survey are you expected? What are their background? Chinese? Workers in MTurk? 

Prof. Ma: hypotheses “some people” → too vague to be hypothesis (always true)... RQs: specify the type of bias you would like to study… Pros and cons of transparency is the subject of study...
