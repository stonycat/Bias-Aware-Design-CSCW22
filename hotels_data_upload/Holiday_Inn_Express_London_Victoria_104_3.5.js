It is within 12 min walk of both. The room was on the fourth floor, it was small but perfectly adequate for a one night solo stay. I slept very well. The bed was very comfortable, the shower had good pressure, two key things for me. The breakfast was good, a small selection of hot and cold choices and pastries. What stands out for me was how friendly and helpful all the staff I encountered were. Prior to arrival I emailed reception to ask if they could print out my coach tickets for travel the next day as I had forgotten to do so before leaving for the airport. Tickets were waiting for me when I checked in. Also the next morning when I realised my phone charging cable was not working", "time": " March 2018", "helpful_vote": 0, "polarity": 0.369, "keywords": "['breakfast', 'morning', 'bed', 'pastries', 'shower']", "categories": ["food"], "userImg": "user-img.png"}, {"user_name": "MNgirl4ever", "user_wrote_time": "Mar 2018", "contriNum": "77 contributions", "helpfulNum": "18 helpful votes", "currentRating": "2.0", "title": "not as nice as I remember", "content": "We stayed here 2 years ago as well and I don't remember the hotel seeming so worn and noisy.
